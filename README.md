# 🎥 YouTube Homepage Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a static clone of the **older YouTube homepage layout**, built using pure **HTML** and **CSS**.

I created this project to **sharpen my frontend development skills**, focusing on clean layout structuring and pixel-perfect UI recreation. While I already have a good understanding of HTML and CSS, this exercise helped me refine and reinforce key concepts.
